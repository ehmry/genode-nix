Its very poorly documented, but it works, mostly.

If it seems that development has stalled, that is because my efforts
have shifted from proof-of-concept to practicalities.

I have many criticisms of Unix, but when used as was prescribed, it is
still by far the best environment available for developing and building
software. To build source-based package management infrastructure
using POSIX tools before refining the POSIX interface of Genode would
be to put the cart before the horse. Therefore my efforts here are for
now my efforts on optimizing POSIX in the Genode upstream.
